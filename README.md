### f.r.k. 
_I am a senior at The University of Texas at Austin interested in Psychology, Data Science, Diversity/Inclusion, and Child Development_ 

ðŸŒ± I enjoy working on quantitative and qualitative research and analysis, and exploring questions related to human behavior. In my career, I hope to become an educator and resource for my community. Using an interdisciplinary approach to Psychology, Child Development, and Data Science, I would like to further inclusivity in research.
